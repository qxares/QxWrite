# QxWrite Documentation

## March 23, 2025
- **Rollback:** Restored working backup from yesterday. Builds clean with basic features (New, Open, Save, Bold, Italic, Font, Color, Image insert). 9 icons loaded from 302 available.
- **New Architecture:** Defined Brick Architecture in `bricks.md`. Starting rebuild with Bold action as proof of concept.
- **Next Steps:** Implement Bold bricks (Function, Handler, GUI, Manager) + `GuiManagerBrick`, test, then expand to other actions.

## March 23, 2025 (Update)
- **Fixes:** Corrected `qxwrite.pro` syntax, initialized Git repo.
- **Build:** Implemented Bold action with new Brick Architecture. Old bricks still present—next step is to refactor them out.
- **Test:** Bold toggles via toolbar/menu, logs completion.
